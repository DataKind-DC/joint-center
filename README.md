# joint-center

Welcome to the Joint Center project for this DataDive!

We want to give the *Joint Center on Political and Economic Studies*, a think tank focusing on African American issues in America, the tools to map out some Census data particularly for the black economy in America. 
This sentence couches a two-fold ask, of which both parts will be detailed in our hand-over document:

**1. Finding the right Census data.**
Census data is comprehensive and impressive but also not so easy to navigate. (Just ask me, I've been drowning in ACS literature on-and-off trying to find some decent variables!). Ideally, we'd want to build out a data-catalog that can be filtered easily in a non-data scientist software (i.e., Excel), but something that can also compose an API call briefly and effectively.

**2. Mapping that Census data effectively.**
Once we have the Census data, we'll need to map the data with visualization software, we've chosen Tableau, a BI software that can be taught to non-data scientists. In this case, we would need:
- to build visualizations in Tableau (i.e., ART CONTEST!!!!!)
- to build a set of best practices from the visualization process
- to teach others how to build those visualizations.

We have gathered some sample data to work with (population and black population), so those who want to focus solely on mapping can get started while the data mining/cleaning team gets to work building out the catalog.

We could use some experts in Tableau and Census API data, but, as we're teaching this to non-experts, *we also need non-experts!* This is a fantastic opportunity to learn how to use Tableau and learn how to mine Census API data!

**To get started,** I'd recommend looking into the **Projects** divider to see what tasks are outstanding, or just finding Mary or me at the Dive.

Looking forward to it. Let's get to work!
