# joint-center

Welcome to the Joint Center project for this DataDive!

We want to give our client, the *Joint Center on Political and Economic Studies*, a think tank focusing on African American issues in America, the tools to map out some Census data particularly for the black economy in America. Their eventual goal is an interactive application that could be embedded on a website, but before we get that far, they would first just like to see *what we can do with the data to start.*

**Objective**: This means a two-fold objective, of which both parts will be detailed in our hand-over document:

**1. Finding the right Census data.**
Census data is comprehensive and impressive but also not so easy to navigate. (Just ask me, I've been drowning in ACS literature on-and-off trying to find some decent variables!). Ideally, we'd want to build out:
- a data-catalog with a cheat sheet of specialized variables that can be filtered easily in non-data scientist software (i.e., Excel), 
- documentation of composing how to customize an API call on the Census website,
- a function within the data-catalog that could compose its own API call effectively, and
- documentation for cleaning the API call for Tableau.

**2. Mapping that Census data effectively.**
Once we have the Census data, we'll need to map the data with visualization software. We've chosen Tableau, a BI software that can be taught to non-data scientists. In this case, we would need:
- to build visualizations in Tableau (i.e., ART CONTEST!),
- to build a set of best practices from the visualization process, and
- to teach others how to build those visualizations.

We have gathered some sample data to work with (population and black population), so the mapping experts/non-experts can get started while the data miners' guild gets to work building out the catalog.

**Expertise Needed** We could use some experts in Tableau and Census API data, but, as we're teaching this to non-experts, *we also need non-experts!* This is a fantastic opportunity to learn how to use Tableau and learn how to mine Census API data!

**To get started,** I'd recommend looking into the **Projects** divider to see what tasks are outstanding, or just finding Mary or me (Matt) at the dive.

Looking forward to it. Let's get to work!
